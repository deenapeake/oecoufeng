                            <p>EDIT: after some sleuthing, /u/Jack\_BE/ (https://www.reddit.com/user/Jack_BE/) had my answer. The Windows Setup in my OSD wasn't correctly seeing the USB dongle, hence no network connectivity. I don't currently have a method of sharing this, but if you end up on this thread and you'd like a copy of the files, feel free to message me and I'll be glad to help. If you have an option for me to share the files, something easy, that the files will be stored on for a while, I'm game to share. Hi, I own a XPS 15 9570 with i7-8750h, 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM DDR4. Everything was working well and as intended to until yesterday when I had the BSOD error of DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE. So I realized it may be time for me to update all my drivers so I did. I used windows update and dell support assist to install the drivers, and after the BIOS update my USB-C to Ethernet has not been working, The error the troubleshooter has said is " Ethernet doesn't have valid ip configuration?". 
Relatively new self built PC. Ran fine for a couple months now I'm starting to get random crashes from no where. Can't seem to track down a cause with my knowledge base. Ran the basics, malware-bytes, windows defender, looked through event viewer, reliability monitor and process monitor but can't seem to find a culprit. Most events only record as unexpected shutdown. No signs of heat damage, all cables secure and connected. ampnbsp; Honestly I've been kind of lost since upgrading. Hello Everyone, First let me start with I am a technician that has worked heavily with computers for decades at this point. Sadly though I am having an issue that I am unable to identify the fix for. So here is what is currently going on. I can play pretty much any video game ranging from those that are cpu intensive to those that are graphic intensive and while there can be small stutters this way it becomes much more obvious if I have chrome/IE running netflix as well. Strangely enough. My PC started acting up a couple of days ago. First it was just tiny hickups that lasted less than a second, like the stuff you get when you install a graphics card driver. The day before yesterday it started freaking out like this from time to time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IZPrt8CQh4 My first thought was that the GPU is busted, hence I threw my Radeon R390 out (still got warranty and Amazon refunds it, means free upgrade to XFX RX 580) and popped my old Radeon 6850 in until the repla. Its purpose is for virus removal and other tech support related tasks. Right now its in the testing phase and currently include a bunch of things including some licensed tools such as Symantec Endpoint Recovery. In terms of some of these, let me know if you have a license for it (and prove it with a reciept), then I'll leave it in there, otherwise I'd be happy to do a custom build. If people want, I can make a video of it in action. It does NOT include things like combofix, but DOES include. 
I'm using an Acer Aspire One 532h: I have dual booted Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows XP (it's what I had and I just need it for iTunes). Ubuntu connects to the internet just fine via wireless connection and I can surf the internet all day without a hiccup. When I booted up to Windows XP I knew I needed drivers so I got them off of this website on my desktop, put them on a USB drive, put the USB drive into my laptop and installed them:. Howdy all. Today I finally invested in some upgrades for my parents family PC, and threw in an SSD and upgraded them to a clean install of Windows 8 (yeah, yeah, boo Windows 8. Whatever, they liked it when they played with it, and it's not my PC so who am I to complain?). Anyhow, so I installed the SSD and did a clean install of Windows 8 to it, and next thing I know the machine has no Internet connectivity! Windows 8 reports "limited connectivity" and seems unable to get a DHCP lease My parents not too long ago decided to move their desktop down to the basement, and were now no longer able to directly connect to the router through a cable. I suggested they buy a wireless adapter and offered to set it up. It worked, for months. Suddenly, it won't connect. I'm pretty sure it's not the router because, I have three other devices connected to the wi-fi. So I've restarted the adapter (turned on and off using the windows troubleshoot thing, I'm on XP by the way), I've tried unplu. I'm hoping /r/techsupport can help where I have failed. For the last forever I've been suffering from major GPU instability. I'm going to break this post down to hopefully make it easier for you and me. The Problem When playing (has happened with pretty much every game: Starcraft 2, TF2, Tribes Ascend, Bastion) two things will generally happen: Artifacts in the form of light blue/pink squares (generally followed soon after by) Monitor going into power save mode then coming back;. Hello, I have 2 parts involved in this question: A Windows XP (5.1, build 2600) Toughbook. A Realtek Wireless LAN 802.11 USB 2.0 network adapter. I had originally connected the Toughbook (with built in WIFI capabilities) to the Boingo network last night, and it was working fine. I wanted to know the brand of WIFI adapter and model so I could download the proper drivers to use it on a different computer. As such I decided to plug the WIFI adapter into my Toughbook and see if I could. Hi r/techsupport, I am looking for onboard lan drivers. Motherboard model is MCP78PVM-PM. Before doing a clean install of windows XP I used belarc advisor, this identified the ethernet card as "Realtek RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC". Searching google results in tons of nasty websites, incompatible drivers and broken links. Thanks in advance. </p>
