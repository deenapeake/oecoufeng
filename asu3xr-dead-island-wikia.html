On the Dead Island wikia, it says Nikolai (Black Hawk Down mission) and Svetlana (Brand Champagne lady) are boyfriend and girlfriend. Has anyone else read this? Where does the info come from?

I figured a lot of you movie lovers are probably interested in the upcoming Godzilla: King of the Monsters movie but not many of you are hardcore Godzilla franchise fans, or even if you are big fans don't know every single movie and monster origin like somebody such as myself who enjoys the genre of Asian monster destruction more than movies in general. So if you're interested, I thought it would be a good idea to give a little introduction and guide of Kaiju movies to watch Wikia — это сообщество интернет-энциклопедий на разные темы.

It may sound unlikely, but I’m pretty convinced Game of Thrones will end like the Bible ends. George Martin had a catholic upbringing, and considers himself a “lapsed catholic”, an atheist. Could he have based the main arc of the story on the apocalyptic end of the Bible? Listen to this. The Bible ends with the Book of Revelation. It’s an apocalyptic text that has been massively influential, and is the very origin of concepts such as armageddon Немногие правила применимы ко всем Вики сразу.

Другие правила для этой Вики должны приниматься. to preface this, I have seen Shadowfrax's video on the rust lore, and it kicked off my interest in the backstory of this game. With how little is in the game lore wise right now, this is pretty much guesswork and assumption, however i think I've got a decent handle on it. A few things before we begin: 1: I agree with Shadofrax on the location of the island being off the coast of Angola. Watch his video for how this was figured out. 2: I used Wikipedia to dig into Angola's history around.

I posted this in /asoiaf and it was very controversial. I think it's important to actually read the quotes from the Book of Revelation below. Remember almost the entire book is quoted. It can't be a coincidence that so much is so similar. It's a long read, but it's worth it. Also keep in mind that George Martin loves to tell stories where the "enemy is just the hero of the other side" and to make us understand that the ones we tend to root for (Dany, Jon) might not be the "good guys" after.

Reposting a theory I put up here about a year ago (slightly edited) because it seems relevant after tonight's ep and the spiral of arms. amp#x200B; Clearly, the symbol of the spiral is an extremely important symbol in the history of Westeros. We’ve seen it several times now, most recently in the caves on Dragonstone in S7E4, and always in relation to the Children of the Forest. From these uses, I believe we can draw conclusions about legendary events and see a general pattern in the history.

Dead Island is a first person action role-playing survival horror video game developed by Techland and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Linux, and OS X.

I was thinking on how ecological shifts can occur after mass extinctions. Someone already did a Squamata dominated Cenozoic so I thought, "Hey? Why not do the last reptile group?" # Prompt: The Cretaceous-Tertiary Mass extinction is even worse than in our timeline, effectively becoming a second Great Dying (Permian-Triassic Mass Extinction) due to compounding factors like another set of volcanic traps the asteroid impact activates.

Intro: Mother 1 is an awesome game for its time and lays a ton of the thematic and lore foundation for the series. It’s gameplay has a lot of cool and interesting ideas but a lot of it has become dated like most RPG on the nes. Vinny is right for skipping this game, but I wanted to write something up for anybody and everyone in the community who was curious about the entire foundation of Mothers story. BUT before you skip over the game part entirely, there’s actually a remake (https://forum.s. Dead Island had Steam trading card support added on July 17, 2013.

What's up with me and this game in particular? Really, here's merely some advice for you: Don't assume that I'm trying anything significant with the placements in terms of installment and all.

And above all that, the fact that this is the fourth SDR2 character in a row really is nothing.
